Sure, here's a simple project idea for a beginner: **"A Personal Expense Tracker"**.

This project involves creating a simple application that allows users to track their personal expenses. Here's a brief outline:

1. **Data Input**: Create a simple interface (CLI or GUI) for the user to input their expenses. The user should be able to enter the following details:
    - The amount spent
    - The category of the expense (e.g., food, rent, utilities) 
    - The date of the expense

2. **Data Storage**: Store this data in a simple database or even a text file. If you're new to databases, you can use SQLite which is a simple file-based database and has bindings available for Python.

3. **Data Retrieval**: Give the user the ability to retrieve and view their past expenses. They should be able to filter by date and category.

4. **Data Analysis**: Provide some basic analysis of the user's expenses. For example, you could calculate the total expenses per category, or show the user's spending trends over time.

This project will help you learn and understand basic programming concepts, file I/O operations, working with databases, and data analysis.
